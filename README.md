# Midas
Systems to extract semantic triples and relationships from LLMs. 

### Background
The largest language models contain a wealth of information on both facts and their relationships, making them ideal tools for populating knowledge graphs. The issue has predominantly been in getting these models to only output truthful, well-formatted completions. As models improve the capability to accomplish this goal will increase dramatically.   

## Template +prompts
Midas is a collection of templates and prompts that can be used to extract well-formatted data. These templates allow for resource minimization when generating large quantities of results (fewer null fields).  
 - Entity-level templates (company, person, subject, location, technology, etc)
 - Relationship example prompt structures
